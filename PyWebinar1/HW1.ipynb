Experience has shown that it works better to loosely-couple logical layers by using abstract interfaces. For instance, the mainline code calls functions and methods in a generic way. Lower-level functions implement matching interfaces for the functionality they provide, ensuring, for example, that all serialization functions used in a program are called in similar fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented languages like Java formalize these ideas. They enable explicit declaration of **interfaces** that classes can implement. An interface definition is basically a collection of function prototypes, defining names and types for functions and parameters that higher-level logic might use to invoke a range of classes. For example, the interface to a range of 'vehicle' classes (e.g., class 'car,' 'motorcycle,' 'tractor') might include start_engine(), stop_engine(), accelerate(), and brake() prototypes.\n",

    "2. Favor object **composition** OVER class inheritance.  \n",
    "**Inheritance** - more generalized base classes can be inherited by derived classes, e.g.\n",
    "A 'duck' class might inherit substantial functionality from a 'bird' class. This requires, however, that the bird class implement a very wide range of methods, most of which may not be used by a specific derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition** - favor implementing a specific class (class - duck) by creating only required unique subclasses (class - quack) along with abstract interfaces (interface - 'ducklike') to classes (class - fly, class - swim) that can be shared widely in similar fashion (class - penguin implements interface 'penguinlike,' enabling sharing of class 'swim,' but not 'fly'). Organizing software in this way has proven to be most flexible, ultimately easier to maintain, and encourages reuse of code."

The benefit of the observer design pattern is that observers can get real time data from the subject when a change occurs. Subscription mechanisms always provide better performance than other options, such as polling.\n",

    "- The subject must have the ability to store a list of all of its observers.\n",
